# source()

Given a source emitter, mirror given events to this pubsub instance.  This is a convenience method, to easily mirror events from the DOM, jQuery or Angular.  It covers most use cases and therefore makes it easier to just plug another emitter into this PubSub class.

Method can be called with options but without channel.  In this case the default channel of '/' is applied.
